The Nebraska Math Ambassadors is an outreach program for elementary and middle school students, primarily in Lincoln and in person at LPS schools. The main goal is to do activities that show students that math is fun. We aim to do activities students would not normally have a chance to do during regular class time, but incorporating topics covered in their math class.

<br><br>

<h2>A few sample activities:</h2>

<br><br>

<li><b>Exploring Platonic solids</b></li>

Students play with platonic solids they can draw on, and ask questions such as: how many corners (vertices) does this solid have? How many sides?

<br><br><br><br>

<li><b>M&ouml;bius strips</b></li>

Students create their own M&ouml;bius strips with paper and tape, and explore this new shape by tracing a line through the <i>middle</i> and experimenting with cutting through their line to see the results.

<br><br>

<li><b>Math Games</b></li>


Several of our activities involve playing one or more math games. Some of the games involve counting, doing basic operations (addition and subtraction), and strategy.



<br><br>

<li><b>Bridges</b></li>

Students try to draw various pictures without lifting the pen from the page or retracing a single line. When can we do this? When do we return to the same place where we started?
