The main goal of CHAMPS is to give graduate students and other early career researchers on the academic job market a platform to showcase their research. CHAMPS started as a weekly virtual seminar in Fall 2020, created by <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a> and <a href=http://ssather.people.clemson.edu>Keri Sather-Wagstaff</a> and based on an idea by Keri and <a href=https://hughgeller.com>Hugh Geller</a>. In the first two years we had weekly seminars. Since Fall 2022, we profile early-career researchers on our website and release elevator pitch videos on our <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>YouTube channel</a>.

<br><br>

CHAMPs from previous years: <a href=year4.html>2023-2024 profiles</a>, <a href=year3.html>2022-2023 profiles</a>, <a href=year2.html>2021-2022</a>, and <a href=year1.html>2020-2021</a>. 

<br><br>

All past videos can be found on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>our YouTube channel</a>.

<div class="profile2">
Olivia Strahan is a sixth year graduate student at University of Michigan. She was advised by Mel Hochster prior to his retirement, and is currently working with Karen Smith. Her research is in commutative algebra. In particular, she developed the idea of <q>p-monomials</q> in order to define and study combinatorial classes of mixed characteristic rings. She has regularly taught introductory math courses as a GSI; in addition, she mentored two semesters of an undergraduate directed reading course, and she worked as a teaching assistant for the MMSS Graph Theory summer camp.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://www.bekchase.com>Bek Chase</a> is a 6th year PhD candidate at Purdue University, advised by Giulio Caviglia. Their interests lie primarily in commutative algebra and its connections to combinatorics. More specifically, they are interested in the Lefschetz properties and related notions. In recent work, they have used combinatorial methods to prove the strong Lefschetz property holds for certain modules and codimension three algebras. Bek is also passionate about teaching and has taught numerous math courses at Purdue. They especially enjoy working with students from underrepresented and/or nontraditional backgrounds and prioritize equity and inclusivity as an instructor.

<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/benjaminoltsik/home>Benjamin Oltsik</a> is a 6th year graduate student at the University of Connecticut, where he works with Mihai Fulger.  His research is in commutative algebra; his specific interests include symbolic powers, integral closure, and analytic spread of ideals, particularly for monomial ideals.  In his first publication, Benjamin found and proved an asymptotic upper bound of symbolic defect.  Benjamin's thesis also details a method for extracting the analytic spread based on the Newton polytope.  During his time in graduate school, he taught a variety of classes, including being the lead instructor for a Linear Algebra course in Spring 2024.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/petermcdonald/home>Peter McDonald</a> is a Lecturer at the University of Illinois Chicago. He completed his PhD in 2024 at the University of Utah under the supervision of Srikanth Iyengar and Karl Schwede and he is primarily interested in using homological and homotopical techniques to study singularities in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His thesis was focused on two distinct problems: developing a new characterization of the multiplier ideal to give a derived splinter characterization of klt singularities and studying homological properties of the relative Frobenius. He is currently working to use these results to study closure operations in characteristic zero and he has also recently developed an interest in the McKay correspondence. He is a dedicated teacher, having taught calculus, statistics, and linear algebra to a wide variety of students, and has also been highly involved in service to the profession through mentorship, conference organization, and volunteering with the Association for Women in Mathematics.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://jakettinger.github.io/>Jake Kettinger</a> (right) is a postdoc at Colorado State University, working with Chris Peterson. His primary area of expertise lies in Algebraic Geometry and its intersection with Combinatorics. More precisely, he is interested in configurations of points, lines, and planes in projective space, which can be understood in the language of Design Theory. He is also interested in the connections between Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory and Dynamics by studying the dynamics of the iterated Hesse derivative on cubic curves. Jake got his PhD at the University of Nebraska&dash;Lincoln under the guidance of Brian Harbourne. Jake Kettinger has taught a wide range of undergraduate classes, and he has experience using Active Learning strategies and implementing Standards-Based Grading in small courses, and experience coordinating large courses.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/kylemaddox>Kyle Maddox</a> is a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Arkansas, working with Lance E. Miller. His area of expertise is in prime characteristic methods and F-singularities, particularly F-nilpotent singularities. He was previously a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Kansas, working with Hailong Dao, and prior to that he received his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri-Columbia under the supervision of Ian Aberbach. In recent joint work, Kyle showed that F-nilpotent rings are always geometrically unibranched, and this property characterizes F-nilpotent curves. He is also a dedicated and passionate teacher, having taught a wide variety of both introductory and major-specific courses. Finally, Kyle is engaged in a number of service projects, including serving on his department's Institutional Excellence/DEI committee.
