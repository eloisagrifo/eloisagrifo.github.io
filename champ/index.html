The main goal of CHAMPS is to give graduate students and other early career researchers on the academic job market a platform to showcase their research. CHAMPS started as a weekly virtual seminar in Fall 2020, created by <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a> and <a href=http://ssather.people.clemson.edu>Keri Sather-Wagstaff</a> and based on an idea by Keri and <a href=https://hughgeller.com>Hugh Geller</a>. In the first two years we had weekly seminars. Since Fall 2022, we profile early-career researchers on our website and release elevator pitch videos on our <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>YouTube channel</a>.

<br><br>

CHAMPs from previous years: <a href=year5.html>2024-2025 profiles</a>, <a href=year4.html>2023-2024 profiles</a>, <a href=year3.html>2022-2023 profiles</a>, <a href=year2.html>2021-2022</a>, and <a href=year1.html>2020-2021</a>. 

<br><br>

All past videos can be found on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>our YouTube channel</a>.

<img src=pictures/VinhPham.jpg width=250>
</div>
<div class="profile2" id="Vinh">
<a href=http://anhvinhpham.com>Vinh Anh Pham</a> is a PhD candidate in Mathematics at Tulane University, advised by Huy T&agrave;i H&agrave;. His research lies at the intersection of commutative algebra and combinatorics, focusing on how convex geometric and combinatorial structures such as Newton polyhedra, Newton-Okounkov bodies, and p-bodies encode algebraic invariants of ideals. He has developed a Volume = Multiplicity formula for Newton non-degenerate ideals, studied asymptotic invariants of p-families of ideals in positive characteristic, and collaborates on projects involving Newton non-degenerate binomial ideals and extensions of F-volumes to filtrations. Equally committed to teaching, Vinh promotes student-centered learning that builds intuition, connects abstract concepts to real-world meaning, and fosters inclusive classrooms where students gain confidence and critical reasoning skills. His dedication as an educator was recognized with the 2025 Tulane Mathematics Department Excellence in Teaching Award.

</div>
<div class="profile2" id="Caitlin">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/caitlindavis/home>Caitlin Davis</a> is a sixth-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Daniel Erman and Jose Israel Rodriguez.  She studies multigraded commutative algebra with a focus on homological questions.  In recent work, she studied the nonstandard Koszul property for a class of rational curves in weighted projective space (joint with Ola Sobieska) and for truncations of nonstandard graded polynomial rings (joint with Boyana Martinova).  Caitlin has been instructor of record for both Preparatory Algebra and Discrete Math, and has worked on multiple projects aimed at improving outcomes in Preparatory Algebra.  She enjoys working with students of all levels through programs such as the Madison Math Circle and the Directed Reading Program.

</div>
<div class="profile2" id="Pankaj">
<a href=https://www.pksusc.com>Pankaj Singh</a> is a PhD student in mathematics at the University of South Carolina, advised by Alex Duncan. His research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and commutative algebra. He studies rationality problems for algebraic tori and toric varieties, as well as the Weak Lefschetz Property for Artinian algebras. In both directions, he is particularly interested in how combinatorial structures arising from toric geometry connect rationality questions with Lefschetz-type phenomena in graded algebras. Pankaj is also passionate about teaching; he enjoys finding clear ways to communicate abstract ideas, and creating an inclusive classroom environment that helps students feel engaged and supported.

<div class="profile2" id="naufil">
<a href=https://naufilsakran.com>Naufil Sakran</a> is a fifth-year graduate student at Tulane University and is expected to complete his Ph.D. by summer 2026. He is working with Mahir Bilen Can. His research interests include semigroups, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and Gromov-Witten theory. He is currently working on two projects. His first project is about studying the correspondence between properties of semigroups and algebraic properties of their corresponding k-algebra. In this work, he has introduced the theory of unipotent numerical semigroups, which generalizes classical numerical semigroup theory to the setting of unipotent matrices. His second project is in enumerative geometry, where he has computed the geometric Tevelev degree for rational curves in certain toric varieties. Besides mathematics, he has two kitties and enjoys playing badminton.

<img src=pictures/Havi.jpg width=250>
</div>
<div class="profile2" id="havi">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/haviellers/home>Havi Ellers</a> is a fifth year math PhD student at the University of Michigan. She was advised by Mel Hochster prior to his retirement, and is now advised by Karen Smith. She works in positive characteristic, studying the nilpotency of Frobenius on local cohomology modules; in particular, she studies a numerical invariant called the Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik (HSL) number. In recent work, Havi found an explicit upper bound for the HSL numbers of affine pointed semigroup rings, and has since also found explicit upper bounds for HSL numbers of toric face rings and certain classes of hypersurfaces. Havi is also interested in teaching; she particularly enjoys thinking about how to communicate concepts clearly, how to share the excitement of mathematics with her students, and how to make everyone feel safe in the often stressful environment of introductory math classes. She has been instructor of record for pre-calculus and Calculus 1, and has also coordinated one semester of Calculus 2.

</div>
<div class="profile2" id="dipen">
<a href=https://www.dipendranathmahato.com/home>Dipendranath Mahato</a> (aka, Dipen) is a 5th year Graduate Student at Tulane University, working with Tai Huy Ha. His research is centered on Polynomial Interpolation, an active area in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, where he tends to find the lowest possible degree of the hypersurface that passes through a given set of points with prescribed multiplicities. Using ideal containment between the symbolic and ordinary power of the defining ideal of points, he recently improved the existing bounds on Demailly's Conjecture. He is also working on Symbolic Rational Powers of Ideals, k-configurations of projective points, and the v-number of several class of ideals. Dipen is a dedicated and effective educator who prioritizes student understanding and a supportive learning environment for all, irrespective of background. Also, he loves mentoring international students on TWOPLES, an online DRP.
