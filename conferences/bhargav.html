Life as a defense contractor and the math used
<br><br>
Abstract: DoD projects have a wide variety of applications. As such, the technology needed is not limited to particular fields. Throughout this talk we will discuss the expectations and work cycle of a defense contractor at GTRI. Furthermore, we will highlight some engineering tools and mathematical principles utilized.

<b>Travel information:</b>

<br>

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is located in Lincoln, Nebraska. If you live within driving distance, we strongly encourage you to drive to Lincoln. If you need to fly, there is an airport in Lincoln, and the Omaha airport is about an hour away by car. The <a href=https://www.omalink.com>Oma-Link shuttle</a> provides transportation between the Omaha airport and Lincoln, but it is unfortunately quite expensive. An one way uber costs typically around &dollar;100; we might be able to cover a few uber rides to and from the Omaha airport, but only if there is a group of participants sharing it. We strongly encourage participants to fly to Lincoln instead.
