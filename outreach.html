<h2><center>University of Nebaraska-Lincoln <br> Math Department Outreach initiatives</center></h2>


<br><br>



<p align="justify">
The UNL Math Department runs two outreach programs bringing university mathematicians and mathematical scientists together with K-12 students. During each session, a university or visiting mathematician will lead high school students through an activity related to advanced mathematics. 

<br>

While the presenters will explain new ideas, the meetings will be centered on activities rather than lectures. The focus is on fun mathematical topics outside of the typical curriculum, and that are of classical interest and have new applications in the modern world.

<br>

UNL faculty and students from a range of different mathematical specialties will be invited to present, to ensure that a broad and exciting panorama of mathematics is conveyed.

<br>

The UML Math Circle is directed by UNL Associated Professor of Mathematics <a href=https://jack-jeffries.github.io>Jack Jeffries</a>, and the Nebraska Math Ambassadors Program is directed by UNL Assistant Professor of Mathematics <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a>.

The UNL Math Circle is an outreach event that brings university mathematicians and mathematical scientists together with high school students. You can request activities in person in your classroom or on Zoom.

<br><br>

The UNL Math Circle is directed by UNL Associated Professor of Mathematics Jack Jeffries. Jeffries wants to encourage more high school students, particularly members of the Hispanic community, to study mathematics. We would like to have at least one session per semester directed in Spanish, and visiting faculty from Latin America will participate as scheduling allows.

The Nebraska Math Ambassadors is an outreach program for elementary and middle school students, primarily in Lincoln and in person at LPS schools. The main goal is to do activities that show students that math is fun. We aim to do activities students would not normally have a chance to do during regular class time, but incorporating topics covered in their math class.
