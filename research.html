My research interests lie in commutative algebra and homological algebra. I am interested in applying homological algebra, characteristic p techniques, and p-derivations to different problems in commutative algebra. I have worked on questions that relate to (infinite) free resolutions, DG algebras, thick subcategories of \(D(R)\), cohomological support varieties, local cohomology, and symbolic powers. Here is a <a href=https://www.cim.pt/magazines/bulletin/42/article/298/pdf>general math audience article</a> article I wrote about symbolic powers, and here are lecture notes I am writing on <a href=SymbolicPowers.pdf>symbolic powers</a> (reader beware: these are under construction!). I wrote <a href=https://doi.org/10.18130/V3707WN5T>my PhD thesis</a> under the supervision of Craig Huneke, on the containment problem for symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals over regular rings.

We characterize symbolic powers of prime ideals in polynomial rings over any field in terms of &#8484;-linear differential operators, and of prime ideals in polynomial rings over complete discrete valuation rings with a p-derivation &delta; in terms of &#8484;-linear differential operators and of &delta;. This extends previous work of the same authors, as it allows the removal of separability hypotheses that were otherwise necessary. The absence of separability and the fact that modules of &#8484;-linear differential operators are typically not finitely generated require the introduction of new techniques. As a byproduct, we extend a characterization of symbolic powers due to Cid-Ruiz which also holds in the nonsmooth case. Finally, we produce an example of an unramified discrete valuation ring that has no p-derivations.
</details>      
</div>
We describe the symbolic powers of a prime ideal in a polynomial ring over any field in terms of differential operators; this extends a well-known result by removing a separability assumption. We give an analogous result in mixed characteristic: we describe the symbolic powers of prime ideals in a polynomial ring over a unramified DVR using differential operators and p-derivations.

Over a local ring \(R\), the theory of cohomological support varieties attaches to any bounded complex M of finitely generated R-modules an algebraic variety \(V_R(M)\) that encodes homological properties of M. We give lower bounds for the dimension of  \(V_R(M)\) in terms of classical invariants of R. In particular, when R is Cohen-Macaulay and not complete intersection we find that there are always varieties that cannot be realized as the cohomological support of any complex. When M has finite projective dimension, we also give an upper bound for \(\textrm{dim } V_R(M)\) in terms of the dimension of the radical of the homotopy Lie algebra of R. This leads to an improvement of a bound due to Avramov, Buchweitz, Iyengar, and Miller on the Loewy lengths of finite free complexes, and it recovers a result of Avramov and Halperin on the homotopy Lie algebra of \(R\). Finally, we completely classify the varieties that can occur as the cohomological support of a complex over a Golod ring.

We show that if R is not a ci, then not every projective subvariety is the cohomological support variety of a complex over M. We do this by establishing upper and lower bounds on the dimension of cohomological supports of complexes over R.

A local ring R is regular if and only if every finitely generated R-module has finite projective dimension. Moreover, the residue field k is a test module: R is regular if and only if k has finite projective dimension. This characterization can be extended to the bounded derived category D<sup>f</sup>(R), which contains only small objects if and only if R is regular.
<br> Â 
Recent results of Pollitz, completing work initiated by Dwyer-Greenlees-Iyengar, yield an analogous characterization for complete intersections: R is a complete intersection if and only if every object in D<sup>f</sup>(R) is proxy small. In this paper, we study a return to the world of R-modules, and search for finitely generated R-modules that are not proxy small whenever R is not a complete intersection. We give an algorithm to construct such modules in certain settings, including over equipresented rings and Stanley-Reisner rings.

Given a local ring that is not a complete intersection, we aim to construct finitely generated modules that are not proxy small, completing a characterization of CIs given by Pollitz. We succeed in this goal for a large class of rings that includes all equipresented rings.

Building on previous work by the same authors, we show that certain ideals defining Gorenstein rings have expected resurgence, and thus satisfy the stable Harbourne Conjecture. In prime characteristic, we can take any radical ideal defining a Gorenstein ring in a regular ring, provided its symbolic powers are given by saturations with the maximal ideal. While this property is not suitable for reduction to characteristic p, we show that a similar result holds in equicharacteristic 0 under the additional hypothesis that the symbolic Rees algebra of I is noetherian.

We give explicit criteria that imply the resurgence of a self-radical ideal in a regular ring is strictly smaller than its codimension, which in turn implies that the stable version of Harbourne's conjecture holds for such ideals. This criterion is used to give several explicit families of such ideals, including the defining ideals of space monomial curves. Other results generalize known theorems concerning when the third symbolic power is in the square of an ideal, and a strong resurgence bound for some classes of space monomial curves.

The symbolic powers I<sup>(n)</sup> of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring
consist of the functions that vanish up to order n in the variety defined by
I. These do not necessarily coincide with the ordinary algebraic powers
I<sup>n</sup>, but it is natural to compare the two notions. The containment problem
consists of determining the values of $n$ and $m$ for which I<sup>(n)</sup> &sube; I<sup>m</sup> holds. When I is an ideal of height 2 in a regular ring, I<sup>(3)</sup> &sube; I<sup>2</sup>  may fail, but we show that this containment does hold for the
defining ideal of the space monomial curve (t<sup>a</sup>, t<sup>b</sup> t<sup>c</sup>). More generally,
given a radical ideal I of big height h, while the containment
I<sup>(hn-h+1)</sup> &sube; I<sup>n</sup> conjectured by Harbourne does not necessarily hold
for all n, we give sufficient conditions to guarantee such containments for
n sufficiently large.

The containment problem for symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals asks for what values of a and b we have I<sup>(a)</sup> &sube; I<sup>b</sup>. Over a regular ring, a result by Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith, Hochster-Huneke, and Ma-Schwede partially answers this question, but the containments it provides are not always best possible. In particular, a tighter containment conjectured by Harbourne has been shown to hold for interesting classes of ideals &mdash; although it does not hold in general. In this paper, we develop a Fedder (respectively, Glassbrenner) type criterion for F-purity (respectively, strong F-regularity) for ideals of finite projective dimension over F-finite Gorenstein rings and use our criteria to extend the prime characteristic results of Grifo-Huneke to singular ambient rings. For ideals of infinite projective dimension, we prove that a variation of the containment still holds, in the spirit of work by Hochster-Huneke and Takagi.

In this paper, we use p-derivations, a notion due to Buium and Joyal, to define a new kind of differential powers in mixed characteristic, and prove that this new object does coincide with the symbolic powers of prime ideals.

The deviations of a graded algebra are a sequence of integers that determine the Poincar&eacute; series of its residue field and arise as the number of generators of certain DG algebras. In a sense, deviations measure how far a ring is from being a complete intersection. In this paper we study extremal deviations among those of algebras with a fixed Hilbert series. In this setting, we prove that, like the Betti numbers, deviations do not decrease when passing to an initial ideal and are maximized by the Lex-segment ideal. We also prove that deviations grow exponentially for Golod rings and for certain quadratic monomial algebras.

We prove some results on deviations that resemble well-known facts about the Betti numbers; for example, that the deviations of algebras with a fixed Hilbert series are maximized by the Lex-segment ideal.

Let R=S/I where S=k[T_1,&#8230;,T_n] and I is a homogeneous ideal in S. The acyclic closure R of k over R is a DG algebra resolution obtained by means of Tate's process of adjoining variables to kill cycles. In a similar way one can obtain the minimal model S[X], a DG algebra resolution of R over S. By a theorem of Avramov there is a tight connection between these two resolutions. In this paper we study these two resolutions when I is the edge ideal of a path or a cycle. We determine the behavior of the deviations &epsilon;_i(R), which are the number of variables in R in homological degree i. We apply our results to the study of the k-algebra structure of the Koszul homology of R.

Symbolic powers arise naturally in commutative algebra from the theory of primary decomposition, but they also contain geometric information, thanks to a classical result of Zariski and Nagata. Computing primary decompositions is a difficult computational problem, and as a result, many natural questions about symbolic powers remain wide open. We will briefly introduce symbolic powers and describe some of the main open problems on the subject, and point to some recent research advances.

We survey old and new approaches to the study of symbolic powers of ideals. Our focus is on the symbolic Rees algebra of an ideal, viewed both as a tool to investigate its symbolic powers and as a source of challenging problems in its own right. We provide an invitation to this area of investigation by stating several open questions.

Symbolic powers are a classical commutative algebra topic that relates to primary decomposition, consisting, in some circumstances, of the functions that vanish up to a certain order on a given variety. However, these are notoriously difficult to compute, and there are seemingly simple questions related to symbolic powers that remain open even over polynomial rings. In this paper, we describe a Macaulay2 software package that allows for computations of symbolic powers of ideals and which can be used to study the equality and containment problems, among others.
