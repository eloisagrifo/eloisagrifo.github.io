<b>Basic course info</b>:

This is the first of a two part course on groups, rings, and modules. In this first half, we will discuss group theory, including group actions, and introduce rings. A major goal of this course is to prepare graduate students for the PhD qualifying exam in algebra.

<br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> While there are no official prerequisites, you should have considerable experience with proof writing. Math 417 is a prerequisite for undergraduate students taking the course.


<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. 

There will be weekly problem sets. You are encouraged to work on the problem sets together in groups, or discuss them with me; you should however write up your own solutions. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes and the textbook. There will be a midterm and a final exam, both in-person. 


<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
<b>Mondays 5 to 6+ pm</b> and <b>Tuesdays 4:30 to 5:30 pm</b>.
<br>
(The + means that I will stay later whenever there are students in my office, but will leave at 6:06 or so if I am alone)
<br>
The office hours past 5:30 pm on Mondays are for Math 817 only; but the remaining blocks are shared with the Math 309 students.
<br>
You can also just drop by my office anytime, or write me an email if you'd like to set up an appointment. If you are looking for me, you might find it helpful to take a look at my <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/scheduleF24.png>schedule for a typical week</a>.

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. You will submit each problem set on canvas as a pdf file. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes and the textbook.
