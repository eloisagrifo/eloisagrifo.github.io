<b>Basic course info</b>:

This is a first course in commutative algebra covering core topics in the field including noetherian rings, graded rings, localization, Nakayama's lemma, integral extensions, primary decomposition, Hilbert functions, and dimension theory. 

<br><br>
Computing examples can be quite difficult. We will learn a little bit about how we can use <a href=http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/>Macaulay2</a> to do calculations; I will not assume you've ever used Macaulay2 before. As surprising as it may sound, we <i>can</i> use a computer to do very abstract calculations!

<br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic ring and module theory, such as the material in Math 817/818.


<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. 

You are encouraged to work on the problem sets together in groups, or discuss them with me; you should however write up your own solutions. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes and the Macaulay2 documentation. The midterm and final exam will be take-home and look a lot like the problem sets, except you cannot collaborate on the problems nor use the class notes.


<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
Just drop by my office whenever, or write me an email if you'd like to set up an appointment. You are most likely to find me in my office on days we have class.
<br>
I have office hours for my undergraduate class on Mondays 4-5 and Wednesday 2-3. Those are times you are certain to find me in my office, though any undergraduate students who come by at that time will have to take priority.

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. 


You will submit each problem set on canvas; each submission will include two files:
<li>The written problems should be in a pdf file, but you are not required to type your solutions. If you prefer to handwrite your work on paper, there are apps like Scannable or Genius Scan that can scan your work into one pdf.
</li>
<li>Any Macaulay2 work you want to submit should preferably be in a .m2 file. If you are a windows user and have to use <a href=https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au>Macaulay2 online</a>, please copy your work (inputs only) to a txt file, and then rename it to be a .m2 file. You can include written comments on your Macaulay2 work in your pdf as well.
