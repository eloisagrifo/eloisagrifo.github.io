Welcome to Homological Algebra!
<br><br>
This course is an introduction to homological algebra; we will assume that nobody has seen homological algebra before.
<br><br>

Homological algebra is the study of homology in a general algebraic setting. While you may have encountered some homological ideas in algebraic topology, homological tools play a central role in other fields. We will learn about some of these tools, building on examples and motivation primarily from the world of modules.

Before we start discussing homological algebra, we will need an introduction to category theory; again, no familiarity with categories and categorical notation will be assumed.
The remainder of the class will be an introduction to homological algebra.
Topics will include complexes and short exact sequences, homology, Hom and tensor, free and projective modules, free and projective resolutions, exact functors, and Ext and Tor. Once we have built enough of these things over R-modules, we will talk a little bit about abelian categories in general, and how to generalize these constructions. Towards the end of the course, we will introduce spectral sequences. 

<br><br>
Computing homology of complexes in general can be quite difficult. As surprising as it may sound, we <i>can</i> use a computer to do very abstract calculations! Sadly, we will not have the chance to learn how we can use <a href=http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/>Macaulay2</a> to do homological calculations; those students who are familiar with Macaulay2 are welcome to ask me about this outside of class.

<br><br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> The official prerequisite is the Algebra sequence at UNL (Math 817-818). If you have taken an introduction to ring and module theory somewhere else, I will allow you to enroll as long as you convince me you have enough background to follow.


<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. You are encouraged to work on the problem sets together in groups, or discuss them with me; you should however write up your own solutions. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes. The midterm and final exam will be take-home and look a lot like the problem sets, except you cannot collaborate on the problems, and you are encouraged to try to solve the problems without checking the class notes. 





<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
Mondays 5 &mdash; 6 pm, Fridays 2 &mdash; 3 pm, and by appointment.

Course notes
</h3>


Here are the <a href=915notes.pdf>Course notes</a>. I will be updating these throughout the semester. If you find any typos at all, however small, please let me know.
<br><br>
Apart from these notes, we will not follow any particular textbook, but recommended sources include:

<br><br>
<li>Rotman's <i>An Introduction to Homological Algebra</i>, second edition</li> (important! The first and second edition are two completely different books)
<li>Weibel's <i>Homological Algebra</i></li>
<li>Mac Lane's <i>Categories for the working mathematician</i></li>
<li>Emily Riehl's <a href=https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context.pdf>Category Theory in context</a></li>
<li>Eisenbud's <i>Commutative Algebra with a view towards algebraic geometry</i> (see the appendices)</li>

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together with your classmates on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. You will submit your work on canvas; your submission should be a pdf file, but you are not required to type your solutions. If you prefer to handwrite your work on paper, there are apps like Scannable or Genius Scan that can scan your work into one pdf.
